# VS Code setup
- Install recommended extensions (see `.vscode/extensions.json`): Nx Console, Prettier, ESLint, Jest Runner.
- Workspace settings are in `.vscode/settings.json`: Prettier as default formatter, format on save, ESLint fix on save, ESLint validates TS/HTML.
- Ensure workspace dependencies are installed (`npm install`) so ESLint/Prettier plugins resolve.
