# apps

This folder contains the runnable applications for the Solargis demo workspace. The main apps are a FastAPI backend (`api`) and an Angular frontend (`frontend`) that together expose and consume solar site data. Use `npm run dev` from repo root to start both, or run per-app Nx targets for individual development.
