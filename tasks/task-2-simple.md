# Task 2 (Simple) — Tests for Filter
Goal: Add basic backend tests that prove the new `status` filter works and rejects bad inputs.

- Cover that filtering by `active` or `maintenance` returns only those statuses.
- Cover that an invalid status is rejected with an error response.
- Consider it done when the tests clearly document and verify the expected filter behavior.
