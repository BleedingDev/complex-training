# Task 5 (Simple) — Quick PR Review
Goal: Do a quick PR review of the filter work (Tasks 1–4) using CodeRabbit or similar and summarize findings.

- Ask the reviewer to focus on API contract, frontend wiring, and tests for the filter.
- Skim the diff yourself for obvious breaks or non-English text; capture any follow-ups.
- Consider it done when you have a brief summary with what’s approved and what needs attention.
