# Task 3 (Simple) — Sites Filter UI
Goal: Show a status filter on the Sites page and reload the list using the new API filter.

- Add a simple control (All/Active/Maintenance/Offline) and hook it up to the site list request.
- Keep the page behavior unchanged otherwise; errors or loading should still make sense.
- Consider it done when changing the filter updates the list to the chosen status.
