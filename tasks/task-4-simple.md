# Task 4 (Simple) — FE Tests for Filter
Goal: Add lightweight frontend tests that show the filter control calls the service correctly.

- Test that choosing a status asks the service for that status; “All” avoids sending a filter.
- Include a small component-level check that the UI triggers the right call.
- Consider it done when tests clearly document the wiring from UI to service with filters.
